# Intro To Ethereum And Smart Contracts

## What is Ethereum?

  Basically, Ethereum is a database that is decentralized. A host of nodes(computers all over the world) that contain transactions that conduct business
  between people, between contacts, and between people and contracts. 

  The reason why Ethereum is decentralizied is because no one can change it, no one can see it, anyone can run it, and anyone can anonymously create on it. Also, in most cases it's pretty trustworthy. Currently the cost to compute is high.

## History of Ethereum

Bitcoin started the whole process back in 2008. The were many contributions made to Bitcoin by blockchain engineers and researchers. As Bitcoin grew it inspired developers and entrepreneurs to create decentralizied apps. However, a problem arose. Inside the Bitcoin community, they were all starting their own blockchains.
There was one innovative individual whose name was Vitalik Buterin who said, "Shouldn't there be one blockchain that everyone can build their decentralizied applications on?" and Ethereum was born. The Ethereum blockchain mimic's the Internet.   

The Ethereum Whitepaper

Vitalik published a white paper on Ethereum in late 2013. Many of the ideas and concepts were taken from Bitcoin. Vitalik wanted a more general purpose blockchain the could do everything that Bitcoin could do and more. 

Bitcoin vs Ethereum

Bitcoin has limitations. It doesn't have a general purpose programming language that "apps" can use to build decentralizied apps. Bitcoin's programming language is currently limited to the point it can't store state or loop through data. 

Other Differences

Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins forever, ether has no limit. If one would say that Ethereum has any draw backs it would be that Ether has an annual ceiling of 18 million per year. Block rewards are different Bitcoin: 12.5 btc Ether: 5 eth. Block rates are different Bitcoin: 10 min. Ether: 15 sec.

## Ethereum In Depth

Is Ethereum the same as Ether?

No, it is not. Ethereum is the network and Ether is the "fuel" that powers the network. Ether is used to pay transaction fees, launch contracts, and call functions from contracts.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine

Ethereum is a network of computers. The EVM is the program that runs the network of computers. And what does the EVM run? Right, smart contracts. 

## Smart Contracts

You can use different languages such as Serpent, Viper, and Solidity to create your contracts. There are also lots of developer tools available. Smart contracts can store data or in developer terms, state. The code can manipulate data based on programming logic. 

Deploying a smart contract

The process is as follow: a) write code, b) compile smart contract down to EVM bytecode, c) send bytecode as part of transaction to the network, and d) transaction gets put into a block and verified.

## Ethereum Yellow Paper

In 2014, ethereum yellow paper was released by co-founder Gavin Wood. It defined the technical specification of the EVM and how it would work.

what's gas?

Gas is the cost of invoking a smart contract method. Gas is a unit of measurement. It determines how much computation the EVM needs.

## What's an ethereum node?

A node is also called an ethereum client. Nodes/clients parse and verify the blockchain and its smart contracts and everything related. There are some nodes that only do wallets these types of nodes place their trust in services that do that for them.

## Question:
             What is a Public Key Hash?

## Question:
             Is Script a part of the NPM library or is it used as a fuction here?

             ex: var script = Script.buildPublicKeyHashOut(address); 

## Question:
             Is the Gas that is used to invoked smart contracts has a cap or limit?
